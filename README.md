# Metrics plugin
 Metrics plugin provides a simple way to show a dashboard of KPI's. 

# How it works
On the control panal you can add metrics, which have two types (metric, parent).

Metric type have a value which can be add and updated.
Parent type have childrens which can be of either type and it's value depends on it's childrens values.

Each metric of either type can have an action item which can be added by the admin.

# Different data for different profiles
Metrics plugin takes a clientProfile query, each clientProfile have it's own data (history data).
